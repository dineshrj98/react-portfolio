<h3 align="center">React-Portfolio</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is a project used to combining all my knowledge learned till date for developing web apps.
    <br />
    This project is a ReactJS with multiple REST API's integrations with Cascaded Style Sheets(.css) for Styling.
    <br />
    It is used to track portfolio performance in comparision to set goals beyond the requirements of the assignment, so I can easier track it.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project started as a project for the unit[IFN666 - Mobile and Web Application Developemnt](https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=IFN666) but since it is a project I build for personal use I continue to develop it.
<br />
**So let it be clear that this is a slow work in progress and I will work on it still although slowly.**

<br />
This portfolio tracker is consistent of three individual parts.
 
 * Client Side Routing
 * API Integration ([GitHubAPI](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api) , [KanyeAPI](https://kanye.rest/), [DummyjsonAPI](https://dummyjson.com/))
 * CSS Styling
 * Error Handling
 
This was a concious choice so in the future I can come back, improve or re-build any of these three parts without affecting the other two.
The *Client Side Routing * is done by a .jsx script that makes use of *react-router-dom* package which is then integrated to all development files to make the page performance efficient for SPA's(Single Page Applications) .
The API's are populated around the page as the middleware and is build with help of the *FetchAPI* and external package called *axios* which offers asychronous capabilities while fetching data to populated and load pages with the obtained data.
The .CSS frontend  adds some nice visuals.
The Error Handling  
<br />
The project allows you to view your repositories from GitHub in the Web App itself. All the public repositoris are available in  page view for you to navigate within the application. Further, as i love to cook, I have added a recipe Search Bar which beutifully populated the recipe which you search for from a DummyAPI. The same code can be reused to fetch products, quotes, tec which are a part of the API offering.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how can get the whole thing up and running on your *local* machine.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
 * [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * [NPM Packages](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo of the branch you want.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dineshrj98/react-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Open a vscode and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo and make a virtual environment.
   ```sh
      cd ./react-portfolio
   ```
   Activate and install all requirements which will automatically install from package-lock.json
   
   ```sh
      npm install 
   ```
   Now you should have all requirements installed that are needed for the project.

6. Now you just have to start the application.
   ```sh
      npm start  
   ```

   Now you should be able to see a browser window popping up with localhost:3000 (for the frontend)
